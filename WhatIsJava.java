**What is Java?**

**Java** is a **high-level, object-oriented, and platform-independent** programming language developed by **Sun Microsystems** in 1995 (now owned by **Oracle**).

âœ… Key Features of Java:

1. **Object-Oriented** â€“ Everything is treated as an object.
2. **Platform Independent** â€“ Code written in Java runs on any platform using JVM (Java Virtual Machine).
3. **Secure and Robust** â€“ Built-in security and strong memory management.
4. **Multithreaded** â€“ Can perform multiple tasks simultaneously.
5. **Distributed** â€“ Supports distributed computing (RMI, EJB, etc.).
6. **Portable** â€“ Easily run across different platforms without modification.

**What is Core Java?**

**Core Java** refers to the **fundamental** features and concepts of the Java programming language. It is the **foundation** of Java that covers the basic building blocks.

âœ… Topics covered in Core Java:

1. **OOP Concepts** â€“ Class, Object, Inheritance, Polymorphism, Encapsulation, Abstraction
2. **Data Types and Variables**
3. **Control Statements** â€“ if, else, switch, loops (for, while)
4. **Arrays and Strings**
5. **Exception Handling** â€“ try, catch, throw, throws, finally
6. **Multithreading**
7. **Collections Framework** â€“ List, Set, Map, etc.
8. **File I/O (Input/Output)**
9. **Wrapper Classes**
10. **Core Packages** â€“ `java.lang`, `java.util`, etc.

ðŸ†š **Difference between Java and Core Java:**

| Feature    | Java                                         | Core Java                                            |
| ---------- | -------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| Scope      | Full Java ecosystem                          | Basic/fundamental part of Java                       |
| Includes   | Core Java + Advanced Java + Libraries + APIs | Only the Standard Edition (Java SE)                  |
| Usage      | Web, Mobile, Enterprise Applications         | Console-based apps, foundational learning            |
| Complexity | Moderate to High                             | Beginner to Intermediate                             |
| Examples   | Web apps (Spring Boot), Android apps, etc.   | Programs using basic OOP, file handling, collections |

ðŸ“Œ Summary:

* **Java** = Core Java + Advanced Java (J2EE, Servlets, JSP) + Frameworks + APIs.
* **Core Java** = The **base of Java**, necessary to understand before moving on to more complex areas.

If you're planning to learn Java, **start with Core Java** first â€” it will give you a strong foundation for building powerful applications later.
